You know what's fun?  Trivia, it's incredibly popular to play no matter where you go.  It's also a good way to spend time with friends, especially if you include some drinks!
As such, we have decided to build a fun, stress free trivia game that allows users to select their own category and difficulty to enable more and more fun!

## User story

I want to be able to select the category, difficulty, and amount of questions asked.
For more fun, I want to be able to find a random cocktail I can make to enjoy as I play.
I also want to be able to replay and re-select categories and difficulty as many times as I please.
```

## Features of the site

- A button on the splash screen that loads a modal calling to a cocktail API and suggests a random drink to make.
- A form with options covering different categories, a difficulty selector, and an input for how many questions asked.
